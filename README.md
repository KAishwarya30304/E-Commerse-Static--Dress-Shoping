# E-Commerse-Static--Dress-Shoping
E-Commerce Static - Dress Shopping is a front-end-only website that showcases a modern, stylish online dress store. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this static web application allows users to:

Browse a catalog of fashionable dresses

Add items to a shopping cart

Update quantities and view total price

Interact with a responsive cart drawer

This is a static project — no backend or real payment gateway is involved. It’s perfect for portfolio projects, UI/UX practice, or as a starting point for a real online fashion store.
